Welcome to GC_bioinfo!
======================================

GC_bioinfo is a collection of bioinformatic programs analyzing PRO-Seq, PRO-Cap, and similar next generation sequencing
experiments analyzing nascent RNAs.
It is primary written in python3, but utilizes R for plotting and C++ for computationally expensive analyses. These
tools were developed in the `Price Lab <https://price.lab.uiowa.edu>`_

# PolTools

PolTools is a collection of bioinformatic programs analyzing PRO-Seq, PRO-Cap, and similar next generation sequencing experiments analyzing nascent RNAs.

It is primary written in python3, but utilizes R for plotting and C++ for computationally expensive analyses. These tools were developed in the Price Lab.
